|**2008-02-03**|**Generating efficient belief models for task-oriented dialogues**|cs.CL|We have shown that belief modelling for dialogue can be simplified if the assumption is made that the participants are cooperating, i.e., they are not committed to any goals requiring deception. In such domains, there is no need to maintain individual representations of deeply nested beliefs; instead, three specific types of belief can be used to summarize all the states of nested belief that can exist about a domain entity.   Here, we set out to design a ``compiler'' for belief models. This system will accept as input a description of agents' interactions with a task domain expressed in a fully-expressive belief logic with non-monotonic and temporal extensions. It generates an operational belief model for use in that domain, sufficient for the requirements of cooperative dialogue, including the negotiation of complex domain plans. The compiled model incorporates the belief simplification mentioned above, and also uses a simplified temporal logic of belief based on the restricted circumstances under which beliefs can change.   We shall review the motivation for creating such a system, and introduce a general procedure for taking a logical specification for a domain and procesing it into an operational model. We shall then discuss the specific changes that are made during this procedure for limiting the level of abstraction at which the concepts of belief nesting, default reasoning and time are expressed. Finally we shall go through a worked example relating to the Map Task, a simple cooperative problem-solving exercise. |[cmp-lg/9505039v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9505039v2)|null|
|**2025-06-05**|**An Efficient Task-Oriented Dialogue Policy: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Injected by Elite Individuals**|cs.CL|Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces. This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times. Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks. |[2506.03519v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03519v2)|null|
|**2025-06-02**|**CoDial: Interpretable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems Through Dialogue Flow Alignment**|cs.CL|It is often challenging to teach specialized, unseen tasks to dialogue systems due to the high cost of expert knowledge, training data, and high technical difficulty. To support domain-specific applications - such as law, medicine, or finance - it is essential to build frameworks that enable non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behaviour with minimal effort. Achieving this requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between developers and domain specialists. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), that converts expert knowledge, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, into executable conversation logic. CoDial can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing languages, such as Colang, to enable interpretable, modifiable, and true zero-shot specification of task-oriented dialogue systems. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset for inference-based models and is competitive with similar baselines on the well-known MultiWOZ dataset. We also demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of LLMs in high-stakes domains. |[2506.02264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02264v1)|null|
|**2025-06-02**|**WHEN TO ACT, WHEN TO WAIT: Modeling Structural Trajectories for Intent Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.AI, cs.CL|Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design. |[2506.01881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01881v1)|**[link](https://github.com/H-Freax/Storm)**|
|**2025-05-26**|**Bridging the Long-Term Gap: A Memory-Active Policy for Multi-Session Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL|Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD. Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1) Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions, and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive performance on conventional single-session tasks. |[2505.20231v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20231v1)|null|
|**2025-05-08**|**clem:todd: A Framework for the Systematic Benchmarking of LLM-Based Task-Oriented Dialogue System Realisations**|cs.CL|The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems. |[2505.05445v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05445v1)|null|
|**2025-04-28**|**TD-EVAL: Revisiting Task-Oriented Dialogue Evaluation by Combining Turn-Level Precision with Dialogue-Level Comparisons**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research. |[2504.19982v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19982v1)|null|
|**2025-04-24**|**PicPersona-TOD : A Dataset for Personalizing Utterance Style in Task-Oriented Dialogue with Image Persona**|cs.CL|Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen domains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona. |[2504.17390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17390v1)|null|
|**2025-02-24**|**MonoTODia: Translating Monologue Requests to Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|Data scarcity is one of the main problems when it comes to real-world applications of transformer-based models. This is especially evident for task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, which require specialized datasets, that are usually not readily available. This can hinder companies from adding TOD systems to their services. This study therefore investigates a novel approach to sourcing annotated dialogues from existing German monologue material. Focusing on a real-world example, we investigate whether these monologues can be transformed into dialogue formats suitable for training TOD systems. We show the approach with the concrete example of a company specializing in travel bookings via e-mail. We fine-tune state-of-the-art Large Language Models for the task of rewriting e-mails as dialogues and annotating them. To ensure the quality and validity of the generated data, we employ crowd workers to evaluate the dialogues across multiple criteria and to provide gold-standard annotations for the test dataset. We further evaluate the usefulness of the dialogues for training TOD systems. Our evaluation shows that the dialogues and annotations are of high quality and can serve as a valuable starting point for training TOD systems. Finally, we make the annotated dataset publicly available to foster future research. |[2502.17268v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17268v1)|**[link](https://github.com/sebastian-steindl/monotodia)**|
|**2025-02-18**|**Simulating User Diversity in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems using Large Language Models**|cs.CL|In this study, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic users and simulating user conversations with a task-oriented dialogue system and present detailed results and their analysis. We propose a comprehensive novel approach to user simulation technique that uses LLMs to create diverse user profiles, set goals, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and evaluate the conversation success. We employ two proprietary LLMs, namely GPT-4o and GPT-o1 (Achiam et al., 2023), to generate a heterogeneous base of user profiles, characterized by varied demographics, multiple user goals, different conversational styles, initial knowledge levels, interests, and conversational objectives. We perform a detailed analysis of the user profiles generated by LLMs to assess the diversity, consistency, and potential biases inherent in these LLM-generated user simulations. We find that GPT-o1 generates more heterogeneous user distribution across most user attributes, while GPT-4o generates more skewed user attributes. The generated set of user profiles are then utilized to simulate dialogue sessions by interacting with a task-oriented dialogue system. |[2502.12813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12813v1)|null|
|**2025-02-02**|**Universal Post-Processing Networks for Joint Optimization of Modules in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Post-processing networks (PPNs) are components that modify the outputs of arbitrary modules in task-oriented dialogue systems and are optimized using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the overall task completion capability of the system. However, previous PPN-based approaches have been limited to handling only a subset of modules within a system, which poses a significant limitation in improving the system performance. In this study, we propose a joint optimization method for post-processing the outputs of all modules using universal post-processing networks (UniPPNs), which are language-model-based networks that can modify the outputs of arbitrary modules in a system as a sequence-transformation task. Moreover, our RL algorithm, which employs a module-level Markov decision process, enables fine-grained value and advantage estimation for each module, thereby stabilizing joint learning for post-processing the outputs of all modules. Through both simulation-based and human evaluation experiments using the MultiWOZ dataset, we demonstrated that UniPPN outperforms conventional PPNs in the task completion capability of task-oriented dialogue systems. |[2502.00747v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00747v1)|null|
|**2025-01-21**|**Leveraging Graph Structures and Large Language Models for End-to-End Synthetic Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Training task-oriented dialogue systems is both costly and time-consuming, due to the need for high-quality datasets encompassing diverse intents. Traditional methods depend on extensive human annotation, while recent advancements leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data. However, these approaches often require custom prompts or code, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. We introduce GraphTOD, an end-to-end framework that simplifies the generation of task-oriented dialogues. Users can create dialogues by specifying transition graphs in JSON format. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphTOD generates high-quality dialogues across various domains, significantly lowering the cost and complexity of dataset creation. |[2501.11977v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11977v1)|**[link](https://github.com/reecall/graphtod)**|
|**2025-03-17**|**Exploring ReAct Prompting for Task-Oriented Dialogue: Insights and Shortcomings**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.HC|Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) (Yao et al., 2022) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing task-oriented dialogue (TOD). We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs severely underperform state-of-the-art approaches on success rate in simulation, this difference becomes less pronounced in human evaluation. Moreover, compared to the baseline, humans report higher subjective satisfaction with ReAct-LLM despite its lower success rate, most likely thanks to its natural and confidently phrased responses. |[2412.01262v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01262v2)|null|
|**2024-11-15**|**Towards Automatic Evaluation of Task-Oriented Dialogue Flows**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-oriented dialogue systems rely on predefined conversation schemes (dialogue flows) often represented as directed acyclic graphs. These flows can be manually designed or automatically generated from previously recorded conversations. Due to variations in domain expertise or reliance on different sets of prior conversations, these dialogue flows can manifest in significantly different graph structures. Despite their importance, there is no standard method for evaluating the quality of dialogue flows. We introduce FuDGE (Fuzzy Dialogue-Graph Edit Distance), a novel metric that evaluates dialogue flows by assessing their structural complexity and representational coverage of the conversation data. FuDGE measures how well individual conversations align with a flow and, consequently, how well a set of conversations is represented by the flow overall. Through extensive experiments on manually configured flows and flows generated by automated techniques, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FuDGE and its evaluation framework. By standardizing and optimizing dialogue flows, FuDGE enables conversational designers and automated techniques to achieve higher levels of efficiency and automation. |[2411.10416v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10416v1)|null|
|**2024-11-15**|**Large Language Models as User-Agents for Evaluating Task-Oriented-Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Traditionally, offline datasets have been used to evaluate task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models. These datasets lack context awareness, making them suboptimal benchmarks for conversational systems. In contrast, user-agents, which are context-aware, can simulate the variability and unpredictability of human conversations, making them better alternatives as evaluators. Prior research has utilized large language models (LLMs) to develop user-agents. Our work builds upon this by using LLMs to create user-agents for the evaluation of TOD systems. This involves prompting an LLM, using in-context examples as guidance, and tracking the user-goal state. Our evaluation of diversity and task completion metrics for the user-agents shows improved performance with the use of better prompts. Additionally, we propose methodologies for the automatic evaluation of TOD models within this dynamic framework. |[2411.09972v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09972v1)|null|
|**2024-11-11**|**HierTOD: A Task-Oriented Dialogue System Driven by Hierarchical Goals**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems assist users in completing tasks through natural language interactions, often relying on a single-layered workflow structure for slot-filling in public tasks, such as hotel bookings. However, in enterprise environments, which involve rich domain-specific knowledge, TOD systems face challenges due to task complexity and the lack of standardized documentation. In this work, we introduce HierTOD, an enterprise TOD system driven by hierarchical goals and can support composite workflows. By focusing on goal-driven interactions, our system serves a more proactive role, facilitating mixed-initiative dialogue and improving task completion. Equipped with components for natural language understanding, composite goal retriever, dialogue management, and response generation, backed by a well-organized data service with domain knowledge base and retrieval engine, HierTOD delivers efficient task assistance. Furthermore, our system implementation unifies two TOD paradigms: slot-filling for information collection and step-by-step guidance for task execution. Our human study demonstrates the effectiveness and helpfulness of HierTOD in performing both paradigms. |[2411.07152v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07152v1)|null|
|**2024-11-08**|**Improving Multi-Domain Task-Oriented Dialogue System with Offline Reinforcement Learning**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.IR|Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system is designed to accomplish user-defined tasks through dialogues. The TOD system has progressed towards end-to-end modeling by leveraging pre-trained large language models. Fine-tuning the pre-trained language models using only supervised learning leads to the exposure bias and token loss problem and it deviates the models from completing the user's task. To address these issues, we propose a TOD system that leverages a unified pre-trained language model, GPT2, as a base model. It is optimized using supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). The issues in the TOD system are mitigated using a non-differentiable reward function. The reward is calculated using the weighted sum of the success rate and BLEU evaluation metrics. The success rate and BLEU metrics in reward calculation guide the language model for user task completion while ensuring a coherent and fluent response. Our model is acquired by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the dialogue-session level which comprises user utterance, belief state, system act, and system response. Experimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 demonstrate that our model increases the inform rate by 1.60% and the success rate by 3.17% compared to the baseline. |[2411.05340v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05340v1)|null|
|**2024-10-15**|**HR-Agent: A Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) LLM Agent Tailored for HR Applications**|cs.CL, cs.AI, 68T07, I.2.7|Recent LLM (Large Language Models) advancements benefit many fields such as education and finance, but HR has hundreds of repetitive processes, such as access requests, medical claim filing and time-off submissions, which are unaddressed. We relate these tasks to the LLM agent, which has addressed tasks such as writing assisting and customer support. We present HR-Agent, an efficient, confidential, and HR-specific LLM-based task-oriented dialogue system tailored for automating repetitive HR processes such as medical claims and access requests. Since conversation data is not sent to an LLM during inference, it preserves confidentiality required in HR-related tasks. |[2410.11239v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11239v1)|null|
|**2024-08-05**|**Infusing Emotions into Task-oriented Dialogue Systems: Understanding, Management, and Generation**|cs.CL|Emotions are indispensable in human communication, but are often overlooked in task-oriented dialogue (ToD) modelling, where the task success is the primary focus. While existing works have explored user emotions or similar concepts in some ToD tasks, none has so far included emotion modelling into a fully-fledged ToD system nor conducted interaction with human or simulated users. In this work, we incorporate emotion into the complete ToD processing loop, involving understanding, management, and generation. To this end, we extend the EmoWOZ dataset (Feng et al., 2022) with system affective behaviour labels. Through interactive experimentation involving both simulated and human users, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the user's emotional experience as well as the task success. |[2408.02417v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02417v1)|null|
|**2024-07-16**|**Evaluating Task-Oriented Dialogue Consistency through Constraint Satisfaction**|cs.CL, cs.SC|Task-oriented dialogues must maintain consistency both within the dialogue itself, ensuring logical coherence across turns, and with the conversational domain, accurately reflecting external knowledge. We propose to conceptualize dialogue consistency as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), wherein variables represent segments of the dialogue referencing the conversational domain, and constraints among variables reflect dialogue properties, including linguistic, conversational, and domain-based aspects. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we utilize a CSP solver to detect inconsistencies in dialogues re-lexicalized by an LLM. Our findings indicate that: (i) CSP is effective to detect dialogue inconsistencies; and (ii) consistent dialogue re-lexicalization is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving only a 0.15 accuracy rate when compared to a CSP solver. Furthermore, through an ablation study, we reveal that constraints derived from domain knowledge pose the greatest difficulty in being respected. We argue that CSP captures core properties of dialogue consistency that have been poorly considered by approaches based on component pipelines. |[2407.11857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11857v1)|null|
|**2024-06-16**|**Making Task-Oriented Dialogue Datasets More Natural by Synthetically Generating Indirect User Requests**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Indirect User Requests (IURs), such as "It's cold in here" instead of "Could you please increase the temperature?" are common in human-human task-oriented dialogue and require world knowledge and pragmatic reasoning from the listener. While large language models (LLMs) can handle these requests effectively, smaller models deployed on virtual assistants often struggle due to resource constraints. Moreover, existing task-oriented dialogue benchmarks lack sufficient examples of complex discourse phenomena such as indirectness. To address this, we propose a set of linguistic criteria along with an LLM-based pipeline for generating realistic IURs to test natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) models before deployment in a new domain. We also release IndirectRequests, a dataset of IURs based on the Schema Guided Dialog (SGD) corpus, as a comparative testbed for evaluating the performance of smaller models in handling indirect requests. |[2406.07794v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07794v2)|null|
|**2024-05-16**|**DuetSim: Building User Simulator with Dual Large Language Models for Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI|User Simulators play a pivotal role in training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems. Traditional user simulators typically rely on human-engineered agendas, resulting in generated responses that often lack diversity and spontaneity. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for generating coherent and contextually appropriate utterances, they may fall short when tasked with generating responses that effectively guide users towards their goals, particularly in dialogues with intricate constraints and requirements. This paper introduces DuetSim, a novel framework designed to address the intricate demands of task-oriented dialogues by leveraging LLMs. DuetSim stands apart from conventional approaches by employing two LLMs in tandem: one dedicated to response generation and the other focused on verification. This dual LLM approach empowers DuetSim to produce responses that not only exhibit diversity but also demonstrate accuracy and are preferred by human users. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ dataset, highlighting improvements in response quality and correctness, largely attributed to the incorporation of the second LLM. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/suntea233/DuetSim. |[2405.13028v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13028v1)|**[link](https://github.com/suntea233/duetsim)**|
|**2024-05-16**|**Many Hands Make Light Work: Task-Oriented Dialogue System with Module-Based Mixture-of-Experts**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-oriented dialogue systems are broadly used in virtual assistants and other automated services, providing interfaces between users and machines to facilitate specific tasks. Nowadays, task-oriented dialogue systems have greatly benefited from pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, their task-solving performance is constrained by the inherent capacities of PLMs, and scaling these models is expensive and complex as the model size becomes larger. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Mixture-of-Expert Task-Oriented Dialogue system (SMETOD) which leverages an ensemble of Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) to excel at subproblems and generate specialized outputs for task-oriented dialogues. SMETOD also scales up a task-oriented dialogue system with simplicity and flexibility while maintaining inference efficiency. We extensively evaluate our model on three benchmark functionalities: intent prediction, dialogue state tracking, and dialogue response generation. Experimental results demonstrate that SMETOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on most evaluated metrics. Moreover, comparisons against existing strong baselines show that SMETOD has a great advantage in the cost of inference and correctness in problem-solving. |[2405.09744v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09744v1)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Unsupervised Flow Discovery from Task-oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI|The design of dialogue flows is a critical but time-consuming task when developing task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. We propose an approach for the unsupervised discovery of flows from dialogue history, thus making the process applicable to any domain for which such an history is available. Briefly, utterances are represented in a vector space and clustered according to their semantic similarity. Clusters, which can be seen as dialogue states, are then used as the vertices of a transition graph for representing the flows visually. We present concrete examples of flows, discovered from MultiWOZ, a public TOD dataset. We further elaborate on their significance and relevance for the underlying conversations and introduce an automatic validation metric for their assessment. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for extracting meaningful flows from task-oriented conversations. |[2405.01403v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01403v1)|null|
|**2024-10-16**|**Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of the Noisy Channel**|cs.CL|Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step. These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline. |[2404.15219v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15219v2)|**[link](https://github.com/jlab-nlp/nc_latent_tod)**|
|**2024-04-23**|**Simulating Task-Oriented Dialogues with State Transition Graphs and Large Language Models**|cs.CL|This paper explores SynTOD, a new synthetic data generation approach for developing end-to-end Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) Systems capable of handling complex tasks such as intent classification, slot filling, conversational question-answering, and retrieval-augmented response generation, without relying on crowdsourcing or real-world data. SynTOD utilizes a state transition graph to define the desired behavior of a TOD system and generates diverse, structured conversations through random walks and response simulation using large language models (LLMs). In our experiments, using graph-guided response simulations leads to significant improvements in intent classification, slot filling and response relevance compared to naive single-prompt simulated conversations. We also investigate the end-to-end TOD effectiveness of different base and instruction-tuned LLMs, with and without the constructed synthetic conversations. Finally, we explore how various LLMs can evaluate responses in a TOD system and how well they are correlated with human judgments. Our findings pave the path towards quick development and evaluation of domain-specific TOD systems. We release our datasets, models, and code for research purposes. |[2404.14772v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14772v1)|**[link](https://github.com/algoprog/syntod)**|
|**2024-04-15**|**Context Does Matter: Implications for Crowdsourced Evaluation Labels in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.IR|Crowdsourced labels play a crucial role in evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs). Obtaining high-quality and consistent ground-truth labels from annotators presents challenges. When evaluating a TDS, annotators must fully comprehend the dialogue before providing judgments. Previous studies suggest using only a portion of the dialogue context in the annotation process. However, the impact of this limitation on label quality remains unexplored. This study investigates the influence of dialogue context on annotation quality, considering the truncated context for relevance and usefulness labeling. We further propose to use large language models (LLMs) to summarize the dialogue context to provide a rich and short description of the dialogue context and study the impact of doing so on the annotator's performance. Reducing context leads to more positive ratings. Conversely, providing the entire dialogue context yields higher-quality relevance ratings but introduces ambiguity in usefulness ratings. Using the first user utterance as context leads to consistent ratings, akin to those obtained using the entire dialogue, with significantly reduced annotation effort. Our findings show how task design, particularly the availability of dialogue context, affects the quality and consistency of crowdsourced evaluation labels. |[2404.09980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09980v1)|**[link](https://github.com/clemenciah/effects-of-dialogue-context)**|
|**2024-03-31**|**DivTOD: Unleashing the Power of LLMs for Diversifying Task-Oriented Dialogue Representations**|cs.CL|Language models pre-trained on general text have achieved impressive results in diverse fields. Yet, the distinct linguistic characteristics of task-oriented dialogues (TOD) compared to general text limit the practical utility of existing language models. Current task-oriented dialogue pre-training methods overlook the one-to-many property of conversations, where multiple responses can be appropriate given the same conversation context. In this paper, we propose a novel dialogue pre-training model called DivTOD, which collaborates with LLMs to learn diverse task-oriented dialogue representations. DivTOD guides LLMs in transferring diverse knowledge to smaller models while removing domain knowledge that contradicts task-oriented dialogues. Experiments show that our model outperforms strong TOD baselines on various downstream dialogue tasks and learns the intrinsic diversity of task-oriented dialogues. |[2404.00557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00557v1)|null|
|**2024-08-20**|**CAUSE: Counterfactual Assessment of User Satisfaction Estimation in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL|An important unexplored aspect in previous work on user satisfaction estimation for Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems is their evaluation in terms of robustness for the identification of user dissatisfaction: current benchmarks for user satisfaction estimation in TOD systems are highly skewed towards dialogues for which the user is satisfied. The effect of having a more balanced set of satisfaction labels on performance is unknown. However, balancing the data with more dissatisfactory dialogue samples requires further data collection and human annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and unlock their ability to generate satisfaction-aware counterfactual dialogues to augment the set of original dialogues of a test collection. We gather human annotations to ensure the reliability of the generated samples. We evaluate two open-source LLMs as user satisfaction estimators on our augmented collection against state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Our experiments show that when used as few-shot user satisfaction estimators, open-source LLMs show higher robustness to the increase in the number of dissatisfaction labels in the test collection than the fine-tuned state-of-the-art models. Our results shed light on the need for data augmentation approaches for user satisfaction estimation in TOD systems. We release our aligned counterfactual dialogues, which are curated by human annotation, to facilitate further research on this topic. |[2403.19056v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19056v2)|null|

While numerous English language multi-domain task-oriented dialogue datasets have been developed and contributed to significant advancements in task-oriented dialogue systems, such a dataset does not exist in Japanese, and research in this area is limited compared to that in English. In this study, towards the advancement of research and development of task-oriented dialogue systems in Japanese, we constructed JMultiWOZ, the first Japanese language large-scale multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset. Using JMultiWOZ, we evaluated the dialogue state tracking and response generation capabilities of the state-of-the-art methods on the existing major English benchmark dataset MultiWOZ2.2 and the latest large language model (LLM)-based methods. Our evaluation results demonstrated that JMultiWOZ provides a benchmark that is on par with MultiWOZ2.2. In addition, through evaluation experiments of interactive dialogues with the models and human participants, we identified limitations in the task completion capabilities of LLMs in Japanese. |[2403.17319v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17319v1)|**[link](https://github.com/nu-dialogue/jmultiwoz)**|
|**2024-03-02**|**BootTOD: Bootstrap Task-oriented Dialogue Representations by Aligning Diverse Responses**|cs.CL|Pre-trained language models have been successful in many scenarios. However, their usefulness in task-oriented dialogues is limited due to the intrinsic linguistic differences between general text and task-oriented dialogues. Current task-oriented dialogue pre-training methods rely on a contrastive framework, which faces challenges such as selecting true positives and hard negatives, as well as lacking diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel dialogue pre-training model called BootTOD. It learns task-oriented dialogue representations via a self-bootstrapping framework. Unlike contrastive counterparts, BootTOD aligns context and context+response representations and dismisses the requirements of contrastive pairs. BootTOD also uses multiple appropriate response targets to model the intrinsic one-to-many diversity of human conversations. Experimental results show that BootTOD outperforms strong TOD baselines on diverse downstream dialogue tasks. |[2403.01163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01163v1)|null|
|**2024-06-28**|**Chitchat as Interference: Adding User Backstories to Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|During task-oriented dialogues (TODs), human users naturally introduce chitchat that is beyond the immediate scope of the task, interfering with the flow of the conversation. To address this issue without the need for expensive manual data creation, we use few-shot prompting with Llama-2-70B to enhance the MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis demonstrates that our enhanced dataset poses a challenge for these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation. These findings highlight the benefits of generating novel chitchat-TOD scenarios to test TOD systems more thoroughly and improve their resilience to natural user interferences |[2402.15248v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15248v3)|**[link](https://github.com/armandstrickernlp/chitchat-as-interference)**|

These methods are crucial for replicating real user interactions, enabling applications like synthetic data augmentation, error detection, and robust evaluation. However, existing approaches often rely on rigid rule-based methods or on annotated data. This paper introduces DAUS, a Domain-Aware User Simulator. Leveraging large language models, we fine-tune DAUS on real examples of task-oriented dialogues. Results on two relevant benchmarks showcase significant improvements in terms of user goal fulfillment. Notably, we have observed that fine-tuning enhances the simulator's coherence with user goals, effectively mitigating hallucinations -- a major source of inconsistencies in simulator responses. |[2402.13374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13374v1)|null|

LLMs are used to translate between the surface form of the conversation and a domain-specific language (DSL) which is used to progress the business logic. We compare our approach to the intent-based NLU approach predominantly used in industry today. Our experiments show that developing chatbots with our system requires significantly less effort than established approaches, that these chatbots can successfully navigate complex dialogues which are extremely challenging for NLU-based systems, and that our system has desirable properties for scaling task-oriented dialogue systems to a large number of tasks. We make our implementation available for use and further study. |[2402.12234v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12234v1)|**[link](https://github.com/rasahq/tod-in-context-learning)**|

We address a gap in prior research, which often overlooked the transfer to lower-resource colloquial varieties due to limited test data. Inspired by prior work on English varieties, we craft and manually evaluate perturbation rules that transform German sentences into colloquial forms and use them to synthesize test sets in four ToD datasets. Our perturbation rules cover 18 distinct language phenomena, enabling us to explore the impact of each perturbation on slot and intent performance. Using these new datasets, we conduct an experimental evaluation across six different transformers. Here, we demonstrate that when applied to colloquial varieties, ToD systems maintain their intent recognition performance, losing 6% (4.62 percentage points) in accuracy on average. However, they exhibit a significant drop in slot detection, with a decrease of 31% (21 percentage points) in slot F1 score. Our findings are further supported by a transfer experiment from Standard American English to synthetic Urban African American Vernacular English. |[2402.02078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02078v1)|**[link](https://github.com/mainlp/dialect-tod-robustness)**|

Their use in the field of Human Resources (HR) has still room for expansions and could be beneficial for several time consuming tasks. Examples such as time-off submissions, medical claims filing, and access requests are noteworthy, but they are by no means the sole instances. However, the aforementioned developments must grapple with the pivotal challenge of constructing a high-quality training dataset. On one hand, most conversation datasets are solving problems for customers not employees. On the other hand, gathering conversations with HR could raise privacy concerns. To solve it, we introduce HR-Multiwoz, a fully-labeled dataset of 550 conversations spanning 10 HR domains to evaluate LLM Agent. Our work has the following contributions: (1) It is the first labeled open-sourced conversation dataset in the HR domain for NLP research. (2) It provides a detailed recipe for the data generation procedure along with data analysis and human evaluations. The data generation pipeline is transferable and can be easily adapted for labeled conversation data generation in other domains. (3) The proposed data-collection pipeline is mostly based on LLMs with minimal human involvement for annotation, which is time and cost-efficient. |[2402.01018v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01018v1)|**[link](https://github.com/amazon-science/hr-multiwoz-tod-llm-agent)**|

In contrast, our work demonstrates that seamlessly unifying ED and TOD modeling brings about mutual benefits, and is therefore an alternative to be considered. Our method consists in augmenting SimpleToD, an end-to-end TOD system, by extending belief state tracking to include ED, relying on a single language model. We evaluate our approach using GPT-2 and Llama-2 on the EmoWOZ benchmark, a version of MultiWOZ annotated with emotions. Our results reveal a general increase in performance for ED and task results. Our findings also indicate that user emotions provide useful contextual conditioning for system responses, and can be leveraged to further refine responses in terms of empathy. |[2401.13789v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13789v3)|**[link](https://github.com/armandstrickernlp/emo-tod)**|
|**2024-01-10**|**Bootstrapping LLM-based Task-Oriented Dialogue Agents via Self-Talk**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via "self-talk" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data. |[2401.05033v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05033v1)|null|

In addition to automatic evaluation, this toolkit features (i) a secure, user-friendly web interface for fine-grained human evaluation at both local utterance level and global dialogue level, and (ii) a microservice-based backend, improving efficiency and scalability. Our evaluations reveal that while PLM fine-tuning leads to higher accuracy and coherence, LLM-based systems excel in producing diverse and likeable responses. However, we also identify significant challenges of LLMs in adherence to task-specific instructions and generating outputs in multiple languages, highlighting areas for future research. We hope this open-sourced toolkit will serve as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop and properly evaluate multilingual ToD systems and will lower, currently still high, entry barriers in the field. |[2401.02208v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02208v1)|**[link](https://github.com/cambridgeltl/e2e_tod_toolkit)**|
|**2023-12-28**|**OmniDialog: An Omnipotent Pre-training Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue System**|cs.CL|Pre-trained conversation models (PCMs) have demonstrated remarkable results in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. Many PCMs focus predominantly on dialogue management tasks like dialogue state tracking, dialogue generation tasks like response generation, or both. However, the existing PCMs seldom consider dialogue comprehension tasks, such as dialogue question answering and summarization tasks. These tasks allow PCMs to glean dialogue context from various angles. This observation naturally raises the question: Can the performance of downstream dialogue tasks be enhanced if a PCM is pre-trained on dialogue management, generation, and comprehension tasks?   To investigate this, we proposed an Omnipotent Dialogue pre-training model (OmniDialog). It unifies these three dialogue tasks into a monolithic framework by multi-task learning, fostering inter-task communication. The pre-training corpus of OmniDialog spans $\mathbf{7}$ dialogue-focused tasks, drawing from $\mathbf{15}$ datasets and encompassing over $\mathbf{3.2}$ million dialogue utterances. To our knowledge, OmniDialog is a pioneering PCM pre-trained across dialogue management, generation, and comprehension domains. We evaluated its performance across four tasks: dialogue summarization, end-to-end dialogue modeling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. The results underscore its efficacy in domain transfer learning, low-resource, and full-dataset scenarios. Furthermore, to glean a nuanced understanding of OmniDialog's strengths and potential pitfalls, we designed a fine-grained analysis framework for dialogue-centric tasks. Experimental results show that the OmniDialog is good at hard samples, such as long dialogues and lengthy responses. |[2312.16864v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16864v1)|null|

The review (1) provides an overview of the used constructs and metrics in previous work, (2) discusses challenges in the context of dialogue system evaluation and (3) develops a research agenda for the future of dialogue system evaluation. We conducted a systematic review of four databases (ACL, ACM, IEEE and Web of Science), which after screening resulted in 122 studies. Those studies were carefully analysed for the constructs and methods they proposed for evaluation. We found a wide variety in both constructs and methods. Especially the operationalisation is not always clearly reported. Newer developments concerning large language models are discussed in two contexts: to power dialogue systems and to use in the evaluation process. We hope that future work will take a more critical approach to the operationalisation and specification of the used constructs. To work towards this aim, this review ends with recommendations for evaluation and suggestions for outstanding questions. |[2312.13871v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13871v2)|null|

While recent advances have capitalized on pre-trained language models (PLMs), they exhibit limitations regarding transparency and controllability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach focusing on inferring the TOD-Flow graph from dialogue data annotated with dialog acts, uncovering the underlying task structure in the form of a graph. The inferred TOD-Flow graph can be easily integrated with any dialogue model to improve its prediction performance, transparency, and controllability. Our TOD-Flow graph learns what a model can, should, and should not predict, effectively reducing the search space and providing a rationale for the model's prediction. We show that the proposed TOD-Flow graph better resembles human-annotated graphs compared to prior approaches. Furthermore, when combined with several dialogue policies and end-to-end dialogue models, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves dialog act classification and end-to-end response generation performance in the MultiWOZ and SGD benchmarks.

|**2023-11-23**|**Searching for Snippets of Open-Domain Dialogue in Task-Oriented Dialogue Datasets**|cs.CL|Most existing dialogue corpora and models have been designed to fit into 2 predominant categories : task-oriented dialogues portray functional goals, such as making a restaurant reservation or booking a plane ticket, while chit-chat/open-domain dialogues focus on holding a socially engaging talk with a user. However, humans tend to seamlessly switch between modes and even use chitchat to enhance task-oriented conversations. To bridge this gap, new datasets have recently been created, blending both communication modes into conversation examples. The approaches used tend to rely on adding chit-chat snippets to pre-existing, human-generated task-oriented datasets. Given the tendencies observed in humans, we wonder however if the latter do not \textit{already} hold chit-chat sequences. By using topic modeling and searching for topics which are most similar to a set of keywords related to social talk, we explore the training sets of Schema-Guided Dialogues and MultiWOZ. Our study shows that sequences related to social talk are indeed naturally present, motivating further research on ways chitchat is combined into task-oriented dialogues. |[2311.14076v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14076v1)|null|

This enhancement is particularly valuable as TODs are often confined to narrow domains, making the mitigation of repetitive and predictable responses a significant challenge. This paper presents a comparative analysis of three chitchat enhancements, aiming to identify the most effective approach in terms of diversity. Additionally, we quantify the divergence between the added chitchat, the original task-oriented language, and chitchat typically found in chitchat datasets, highlighting the top 20 divergent keywords for each comparison. Our findings drive a discussion on future enhancements for augmenting TODs, emphasizing the importance of grounding dialogues beyond the task to achieve more diverse and natural exchanges. |[2311.14067v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14067v2)|**[link](https://github.com/armandstrickernlp/task-chitchat-entropy)**|

|**2023-11-15**|**Workflow-Guided Response Generation for Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems aim to achieve specific goals through interactive dialogue. Such tasks usually involve following specific workflows, i.e. executing a sequence of actions in a particular order. While prior work has focused on supervised learning methods to condition on past actions, they do not explicitly optimize for compliance to a desired workflow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to generate dialogue responses that are aligned with a given workflow. Our framework consists of ComplianceScorer, a metric designed to evaluate how well a generated response executes the specified action, combined with an RL opimization process that utilizes an interactive sampling technique. We evaluate our approach on two TOD datasets, Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD) (Chen et al., 2021a) and MultiWOZ 2.2 (Zang et al., 2020) on a range of automated and human evaluation metrics. Our findings indicate that our RL-based framework outperforms baselines and is effective at enerating responses that both comply with the intended workflows while being expressed in a natural and fluent manner. |[2311.08300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08300v1)|null|

However, the biased behavior of each component in a TOD system and the error propagation issue in the end-to-end framework can lead to seriously biased TOD responses. Existing works of fairness only focus on the total bias of a system. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis method to attribute bias to each component of a TOD system. With the proposed attribution method, we can gain a deeper understanding of the sources of bias. Additionally, researchers can mitigate biased model behavior at a more granular level. We conduct experiments to attribute the TOD system's bias toward three demographic axes: gender, age, and race. Experimental results show that the bias of a TOD system usually comes from the response generation model. |[2311.06513v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06513v2)|null|

We extend two English ToD datasets to Indonesian, comprising four different domains by delexicalization to efficiently reduce the size of annotations.

|**2023-10-31**|**Multi-User MultiWOZ: Task-Oriented Dialogues among Multiple Users**|cs.CL|While most task-oriented dialogues assume conversations between the agent and one user at a time, dialogue systems are increasingly expected to communicate with multiple users simultaneously who make decisions collaboratively. To facilitate development of such systems, we release the Multi-User MultiWOZ dataset: task-oriented dialogues among two users and one agent. To collect this dataset, each user utterance from MultiWOZ 2.2 was replaced with a small chat between two users that is semantically and pragmatically consistent with the original user utterance, thus resulting in the same dialogue state and system response. These dialogues reflect interesting dynamics of collaborative decision-making in task-oriented scenarios, e.g., social chatter and deliberation. Supported by this data, we propose the novel task of multi-user contextual query rewriting: to rewrite a task-oriented chat between two users as a concise task-oriented query that retains only task-relevant information and that is directly consumable by the dialogue system. We demonstrate that in multi-user dialogues, using predicted rewrites substantially improves dialogue state tracking without modifying existing dialogue systems that are trained for single-user dialogues. Further, this method surpasses training a medium-sized model directly on multi-user dialogues and generalizes to unseen domains. |[2310.20479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20479v1)|**[link](https://github.com/yohanjo/multiuser_multiwoz)**|

However, current approaches generally integrate knowledge retrieval and response generation, which poses scalability challenges when dealing with extensive knowledge bases. Taking inspiration from open-domain question answering, we propose a retriever-generator architecture that harnesses a retriever to retrieve pertinent knowledge and a generator to generate system responses.~Due to the lack of retriever training labels, we propose relying on feedback from the generator as pseudo-labels to train the retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a dual-feedback mechanism that generates both positive and negative feedback based on the output of the generator. Our method demonstrates superior performance in task-oriented dialogue tasks, as evidenced by experimental results on three benchmark datasets. |[2310.14528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14528v1)|null|

In this work, we take stock of and empirically analyse task performance disparities that exist between multilingual task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems. We first define new quantitative measures of absolute and relative equivalence in system performance, capturing disparities across languages and within individual languages. Through a series of controlled experiments, we demonstrate that performance disparities depend on a number of factors: the nature of the ToD task at hand, the underlying pretrained language model, the target language, and the amount of ToD annotated data. We empirically prove the existence of the adaptation and intrinsic biases in current ToD systems: e.g., ToD systems trained for Arabic or Turkish using annotated ToD data fully parallel to English ToD data still exhibit diminished ToD task performance. Beyond providing a series of insights into the performance disparities of ToD systems in different languages, our analyses offer practical tips on how to approach ToD data collection and system development for new languages. |[2310.12892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12892v1)|null|

Furthermore, a rigorous human evaluation of end-to-end TODS shows that InstructTODS produces dialogue responses that notably outperform both the gold responses and the state-of-the-art TODS in terms of helpfulness, informativeness, and humanness. Moreover, the effectiveness of LLMs in TODS is further supported by our comprehensive evaluations on TODS subtasks: dialogue state tracking, intent classification, and response generation.

|**2023-10-20**|**Retrieval-Generation Alignment for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue System**|cs.CL|Developing an efficient retriever to retrieve knowledge from a large-scale knowledge base (KB) is critical for task-oriented dialogue systems to effectively handle localized and specialized tasks. However, widely used generative models such as T5 and ChatGPT often struggle to differentiate subtle differences among the retrieved KB records when generating responses, resulting in suboptimal quality of generated responses. In this paper, we propose the application of maximal marginal likelihood to train a perceptive retriever by utilizing signals from response generation for supervision. In addition, our approach goes beyond considering solely retrieved entities and incorporates various meta knowledge to guide the generator, thus improving the utilization of knowledge. We evaluate our approach on three task-oriented dialogue datasets using T5 and ChatGPT as the backbone models. The results demonstrate that when combined with meta knowledge, the response generator can effectively leverage high-quality knowledge records from the retriever and enhance the quality of generated responses. The codes and models of this paper are available at https://github.com/shenwzh3/MK-TOD. |[2310.08877v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08877v2)|**[link](https://github.com/shenwzh3/mk-tod)**|

The LENS Framework has been proposed as a method to solve computer vision tasks without additional training and with fixed parameters of pre-trained models. We used the Multimodal Dialogs (MMD) dataset, a multimodal task-oriented dialogue benchmark dataset from the fashion field, and for the evaluation, we used the ChatGPT-based G-EVAL, which only accepts textual modalities, with arrangements to handle multimodal data. Compared to Transformer-based models in previous studies, our method demonstrated an absolute lift of 10.8% in fluency, 8.8% in usefulness, and 5.2% in relevance and coherence. The results show that using large-scale models with fixed parameters rather than using models trained on a dataset from scratch improves performance in multimodal task-oriented dialogues. At the same time, we show that Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for multimodal task-oriented dialogues. This is expected to lead to efficient applications to existing systems. |[2310.00845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00845v1)|null|
|**2023-09-23**|**User Simulation with Large Language Models for Evaluating Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL|One of the major impediments to the development of new task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems is the need for human evaluation at multiple stages and iterations of the development process. In an effort to move toward automated evaluation of TOD, we propose a novel user simulator built using recently developed large pretrained language models (LLMs). In order to increase the linguistic diversity of our system relative to the related previous work, we do not fine-tune the LLMs used by our system on existing TOD datasets; rather we use in-context learning to prompt the LLMs to generate robust and linguistically diverse output with the goal of simulating the behavior of human interlocutors. Unlike previous work, which sought to maximize goal success rate (GSR) as the primary metric of simulator performance, our goal is a system which achieves a GSR similar to that observed in human interactions with TOD systems. Using this approach, our current simulator is effectively able to interact with several TOD systems, especially on single-intent conversational goals, while generating lexically and syntactically diverse output relative to previous simulators that rely upon fine-tuned models. Finally, we collect a Human2Bot dataset of humans interacting with the same TOD systems with which we experimented in order to better quantify these achievements. |[2309.13233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13233v1)|null|
|**2023-09-16**|**Enhancing Large Language Model Induced Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems Through Look-Forward Motivated Goals**|cs.CL|Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been significantly enhanced the question answering and dialogue generation, and makes them become increasingly popular in current practical scenarios. While unlike the general dialogue system which emphasizes the semantic performance, the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems aim to achieve the dialogue goal efficiently and successfully in multiple turns. Unfortunately, existing LLM-induced ToD systems lack the direct reward toward the final goal and do not take account of the dialogue proactivity that can strengthen the dialogue efficiency. To fill these gaps, we introduce the ProToD (Proactively Goal-Driven LLM-Induced ToD) approach, which anticipates the future dialogue actions and incorporates the goal-oriented reward signal to enhance ToD systems. Additionally, we present a novel evaluation method that assesses ToD systems based on goal-driven dialogue simulations. This method allows us to gauge user satisfaction, system efficiency and successful rate while overcoming the limitations of current Information and Success metrics. Empirical experiments conducted on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate that our model can achieve superior performance using only 10% of the data compared to previous end-to-end fully supervised models. This improvement is accompanied by enhanced user satisfaction and efficiency. |[2309.08949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08949v1)|null|
|**2023-08-24**|**From Chatter to Matter: Addressing Critical Steps of Emotion Recognition Learning in Task-oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL|Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a crucial task for building human-like conversational agents. While substantial efforts have been devoted to ERC for chit-chat dialogues, the task-oriented counterpart is largely left unattended. Directly applying chit-chat ERC models to task-oriented dialogues (ToDs) results in suboptimal performance as these models overlook key features such as the correlation between emotions and task completion in ToDs. In this paper, we propose a framework that turns a chit-chat ERC model into a task-oriented one, addressing three critical aspects: data, features and objective. First, we devise two ways of augmenting rare emotions to improve ERC performance. Second, we use dialogue states as auxiliary features to incorporate key information from the goal of the user. Lastly, we leverage a multi-aspect emotion definition in ToDs to devise a multi-task learning objective and a novel emotion-distance weighted loss function. Our framework yields significant improvements for a range of chit-chat ERC models on EmoWOZ, a large-scale dataset for user emotion in ToDs. We further investigate the generalisability of the best resulting model to predict user satisfaction in different ToD datasets. A comparison with supervised baselines shows a strong zero-shot capability, highlighting the potential usage of our framework in wider scenarios. |[2308.12648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12648v1)|null|

While current LLMs proficiently answer general questions, they often fall short in complex diagnostic scenarios such as legal, medical, or other specialized consultations. These scenarios typically require Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD), where an AI chat agent must proactively pose questions and guide users toward specific goals or task completion. Previous fine-tuning models have underperformed in TOD and the full potential of conversational capability in current LLMs has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce DiagGPT (Dialogue in Diagnosis GPT), an innovative approach that extends LLMs to more TOD scenarios. In addition to guiding users to complete tasks, DiagGPT can effectively manage the status of all topics throughout the dialogue development. This feature enhances user experience and offers a more flexible interaction in TOD. Our experiments demonstrate that DiagGPT exhibits outstanding performance in conducting TOD with users, showing its potential for practical applications in various fields. |[2308.08043v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08043v4)|null|
|**2023-08-06**|**System-Initiated Transitions from Chit-Chat to Task-Oriented Dialogues with Transition Info Extractor and Transition Sentence Generator**|cs.CL|In this work, we study dialogue scenarios that start from chit-chat but eventually switch to task-related services, and investigate how a unified dialogue model, which can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues, takes the initiative during the dialogue mode transition from chit-chat to task-oriented in a coherent and cooperative manner. We firstly build a {transition info extractor} (TIE) that keeps track of the preceding chit-chat interaction and detects the potential user intention to switch to a task-oriented service. Meanwhile, in the unified model, a {transition sentence generator} (TSG) is extended through efficient Adapter tuning and transition prompt learning. When the TIE successfully finds task-related information from the preceding chit-chat, such as a transition domain, then the TSG is activated automatically in the unified model to initiate this transition by generating a transition sentence under the guidance of transition information extracted by TIE. The experimental results show promising performance regarding the proactive transitions. We achieve an additional large improvement on TIE model by utilizing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The TSG can flexibly generate transition sentences while maintaining the unified capabilities of normal chit-chat and task-oriented response generation. |[2308.03098v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03098v1)|null|
|**2023-08-01**|**DiactTOD: Learning Generalizable Latent Dialogue Acts for Controllable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL|Dialogue act annotations are important to improve response generation quality in task-oriented dialogue systems. However, it can be challenging to use dialogue acts to control response generation in a generalizable way because different datasets and tasks may have incompatible annotations. While alternative methods that utilize latent action spaces or reinforcement learning do not require explicit annotations, they may lack interpretability or face difficulties defining task-specific rewards. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end latent dialogue act model (DiactTOD) that represents dialogue acts in a latent space. DiactTOD, when pre-trained on a large corpus, is able to predict and control dialogue acts to generate controllable responses using these latent representations in a zero-shot fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of experimental settings on the MultiWOZ dataset, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full data fine-tuning with both end-to-end and policy optimization configurations. |[2308.00878v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00878v1)|null|

To enhance the dialogue experience, we explore a series of data augmentation strategies using LLMs to train advanced neural models continuously.

SimpleMTOD is built on a large-scale transformer-based auto-regressive architecture, which has already proven to be successful in uni-modal task-oriented dialogues, and effectively leverages transfer learning from pre-trained GPT-2. In-order to capture the semantics of visual scenes, we introduce both local and de-localized tokens for objects within a scene. De-localized tokens represent the type of an object rather than the specific object itself and so possess a consistent meaning across the dataset. SimpleMTOD achieves a state-of-the-art BLEU score (0.327) in the Response Generation sub-task of the SIMMC 2.0 test-std dataset while performing on par in other multimodal sub-tasks: Disambiguation, Coreference Resolution, and Dialog State Tracking. This is despite taking a minimalist approach for extracting visual (and non-visual) information. In addition the model does not rely on task-specific architectural changes such as classification heads. |[2307.04907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04907v1)|null|
|**2023-07-04**|**Unified Conversational Models with System-Initiated Transitions between Chit-Chat and Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) have been separately developed under two different categories, task-oriented and chit-chat. The former focuses on achieving functional goals and the latter aims at creating engaging social conversations without special goals. Creating a unified conversational model that can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogue is a promising research topic in recent years. However, the potential ``initiative'' that occurs when there is a change between dialogue modes in one dialogue has rarely been explored. In this work, we investigate two kinds of dialogue scenarios, one starts from chit-chat implicitly involving task-related topics and finally switching to task-oriented requests; the other starts from task-oriented interaction and eventually changes to casual chat after all requested information is provided. We contribute two efficient prompt models which can proactively generate a transition sentence to trigger system-initiated transitions in a unified dialogue model. One is a discrete prompt model trained with two discrete tokens, the other one is a continuous prompt model using continuous prompt embeddings automatically generated by a classifier. We furthermore show that the continuous prompt model can also be used to guide the proactive transitions between particular domains in a multi-domain task-oriented setting. |[2307.01664v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01664v1)|null|
|**2023-06-17**|**FutureTOD: Teaching Future Knowledge to Pre-trained Language Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL|Pre-trained language models based on general text enable huge success in the NLP scenario. But the intrinsical difference of linguistic patterns between general text and task-oriented dialogues makes existing pre-trained language models less useful in practice. Current dialogue pre-training methods rely on a contrastive framework and face the challenges of both selecting true positives and hard negatives. In this paper, we propose a novel dialogue pre-training model, FutureTOD, which distills future knowledge to the representation of the previous dialogue context using a self-training framework. Our intuition is that a good dialogue representation both learns local context information and predicts future information. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream dialogue tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, especially the generalization, robustness, and learning discriminative dialogue representations capabilities. |[2306.10315v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10315v1)|**[link](https://github.com/zeng-wh/futuretod)**|
|**2023-06-02**|**Improving Generalization in Task-oriented Dialogues with Workflows and Action Plans**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Task-oriented dialogue is difficult in part because it involves understanding user intent, collecting information from the user, executing API calls, and generating helpful and fluent responses. However, for complex tasks one must also correctly do all of these things over multiple steps, and in a specific order. While large pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned end-to-end to create multi-step task-oriented dialogue agents that generate fluent text, our experiments confirm that this approach alone cannot reliably perform new multi-step tasks that are unseen during training. To address these limitations, we augment the dialogue contexts given to \textmd{text2text} transformers with known \textit{valid workflow names} and \textit{action plans}. Action plans consist of sequences of actions required to accomplish a task, and are encoded as simple sequences of keywords (e.g. verify-identity, pull-up-account, reset-password, etc.). We perform extensive experiments on the Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD) with T5-small, base and large models, and show that such models: a) are able to more readily generalize to unseen workflows by following the provided plan, and b) are able to generalize to executing unseen actions if they are provided in the plan. In contrast, models are unable to fully accomplish new multi-step tasks when they are not provided action plan information, even when given new valid workflow names. |[2306.01729v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01729v1)|null|
|**2023-06-05**|**EmoUS: Simulating User Emotions in Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|Existing user simulators (USs) for task-oriented dialogue systems only model user behaviour on semantic and natural language levels without considering the user persona and emotions. Optimising dialogue systems with generic user policies, which cannot model diverse user behaviour driven by different emotional states, may result in a high drop-off rate when deployed in the real world. Thus, we present EmoUS, a user simulator that learns to simulate user emotions alongside user behaviour. EmoUS generates user emotions, semantic actions, and natural language responses based on the user goal, the dialogue history, and the user persona. By analysing what kind of system behaviour elicits what kind of user emotions, we show that EmoUS can be used as a probe to evaluate a variety of dialogue systems and in particular their effect on the user's emotional state. Developing such methods is important in the age of large language model chat-bots and rising ethical concerns. |[2306.01579v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01579v1)|null|
|**2023-05-26**|**Schema-Guided User Satisfaction Modeling for Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI|User Satisfaction Modeling (USM) is one of the popular choices for task-oriented dialogue systems evaluation, where user satisfaction typically depends on whether the user's task goals were fulfilled by the system. Task-oriented dialogue systems use task schema, which is a set of task attributes, to encode the user's task goals. Existing studies on USM neglect explicitly modeling the user's task goals fulfillment using the task schema. In this paper, we propose SG-USM, a novel schema-guided user satisfaction modeling framework. It explicitly models the degree to which the user's preferences regarding the task attributes are fulfilled by the system for predicting the user's satisfaction level. SG-USM employs a pre-trained language model for encoding dialogue context and task attributes. Further, it employs a fulfillment representation layer for learning how many task attributes have been fulfilled in the dialogue, an importance predictor component for calculating the importance of task attributes. Finally, it predicts the user satisfaction based on task attribute fulfillment and task attribute importance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e. MWOZ, SGD, ReDial, and JDDC) show that SG-USM consistently outperforms competitive existing methods. Our extensive analysis demonstrates that SG-USM can improve the interpretability of user satisfaction modeling, has good scalability as it can effectively deal with unseen tasks and can also effectively work in low-resource settings by leveraging unlabeled data. |[2305.16798v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16798v1)|**[link](https://github.com/amzn/user-satisfaction-modeling)**|

We discover that data utilization efficiency in low-resource scenarios can be enhanced by mining alignment information uncertain utterance and deterministic dialogue state. Therefore, we innovatively implement dual learning in task-oriented dialogues to exploit the correlation of heterogeneous data. In addition, the one-to-one duality is converted into a multijugate duality to reduce the influence of spurious correlations in dual training for generalization. Without introducing additional parameters, our method could be implemented in arbitrary networks. Extensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our proposed method improves the effectiveness of end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems under multiple benchmarks and obtains state-of-the-art results in low-resource scenarios. |[2305.16106v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16106v1)|null|
|**2023-05-23**|**Revealing User Familiarity Bias in Task-Oriented Dialogue via Interactive Evaluation**|cs.CL|Most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) benchmarks assume users that know exactly how to use the system by constraining the user behaviors within the system's capabilities via strict user goals, namely "user familiarity" bias. This data bias deepens when it combines with data-driven TOD systems, as it is impossible to fathom the effect of it with existing static evaluations. Hence, we conduct an interactive user study to unveil how vulnerable TOD systems are against realistic scenarios. In particular, we compare users with 1) detailed goal instructions that conform to the system boundaries (closed-goal) and 2) vague goal instructions that are often unsupported but realistic (open-goal). Our study reveals that conversations in open-goal settings lead to catastrophic failures of the system, in which 92% of the dialogues had significant issues. Moreover, we conduct a thorough analysis to identify distinctive features between the two settings through error annotation. From this, we discover a novel "pretending" behavior, in which the system pretends to handle the user requests even though they are beyond the system's capabilities. We discuss its characteristics and toxicity while emphasizing transparency and a fallback strategy for robust TOD systems. |[2305.13857v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13857v1)|null|

However, such design often causes misalignment between the agent response and external knowledge, due to inadequate representation of information. Furthermore, its evaluation metrics emphasize assessing the agent's pre-lexicalization response, neglecting the quality of the completed response. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that uses a textual interface to align external knowledge and eliminate redundant processes. We demonstrate our paradigm in practice through MultiWOZ-Remake, including an interactive textual interface built for the MultiWOZ database and a correspondingly re-processed dataset. We train an end-to-end dialogue system to evaluate this new dataset. The experimental results show that our approach generates more natural final responses and achieves a greater task success rate compared to the previous models. |[2305.13710v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13710v1)|null|

Users of such systems often do not know all the information about the task they are trying to accomplish, requiring them to seek information about the task. To provide accurate and personalized task-oriented information seeking results, task-oriented dialogue systems need to address two potential issues: 1) users' inability to describe their complex information needs in their requests; and 2) ambiguous/missing information the system has about the users. In this paper, we propose a new Multi-Attention Seq2Seq Network, named MAS2S, which can ask questions to clarify the user's information needs and the user's profile in task-oriented information seeking. We also extend an existing dataset for task-oriented information seeking, leading to the \ourdataset which contains about 100k task-oriented information seeking dialogues that are made publicly available\footnote{Dataset and code is available at \href{https://github.com/sweetalyssum/clarit}{https://github.com/sweetalyssum/clarit}.}.

However, previous studies primarily focus on datasets written by annotators, which has resulted in a gap between academic research and real-world spoken conversation scenarios. While several small-scale spoken TOD datasets are proposed to address robustness issues such as ASR errors, they ignore the unique challenges in spoken conversation. To tackle the limitations, we introduce SpokenWOZ, a large-scale speech-text dataset for spoken TOD, containing 8 domains, 203k turns, 5.7k dialogues and 249 hours of audios from human-to-human spoken conversations. SpokenWOZ further incorporates common spoken characteristics such as word-by-word processing and reasoning in spoken language. Based on these characteristics, we present cross-turn slot and reasoning slot detection as new challenges. We conduct experiments on various baselines, including text-modal models, newly proposed dual-modal models, and LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. The results show that the current models still have substantial room for improvement in spoken conversation, where the most advanced dialogue state tracker only achieves 25.65% in joint goal accuracy and the SOTA end-to-end model only correctly completes the user request in 52.1% of dialogues.

The amount of wasted invalid exploration makes their learning inefficient. In this paper, we find and define an important reason for the invalid exploration: dead-ends. When a conversation enters a dead-end state, regardless of the actions taken afterward, it will continue in a dead-end trajectory until the agent reaches a termination state or maximum turn. We propose a dead-end resurrection (DDR) algorithm that detects the initial dead-end state in a timely and efficient manner and provides a rescue action to guide and correct the exploration direction. To prevent dialogue policies from repeatedly making the same mistake, DDR also performs dialogue data augmentation by adding relevant experiences containing dead-end states. We first validate the dead-end detection reliability and then demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the method by reporting experimental results on several dialogue datasets from different domains. |[2305.03262v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03262v1)|null|

Recently, end-to-end dialogue models pre-trained based on large datasets have shown promising performance in the conversational system. However, they share the same parameters to train tasks of the dialogue system (NLU, DST, NLG), so debugging each task is challenging. Also, they require a lot of effort to fine-tune large parameters to create a task-oriented chatbot, making it difficult for non-experts to handle. Therefore, we intend to train relatively lightweight and fast models compared to PLM. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end TOD system with Task-Optimized Adapters which learn independently per task, adding only small number of parameters after fixed layers of pre-trained network. We also enhance the performance of the DST and NLG modules through reinforcement learning, overcoming the learning curve that has lacked at the adapter learning and enabling the natural and consistent response generation that is appropriate for the goal. Our method is a model-agnostic approach and does not require prompt-tuning as only input data without a prompt. As results of the experiment, our method shows competitive performance on the MultiWOZ benchmark compared to the existing end-to-end models. In particular, we attain state-of-the-art performance on the DST task of 2.2 dataset. |[2305.02468v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02468v3)|**[link](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz)**|

In this paper, we propose a task-oriented dialogue system via action-level generation. Specifically, we first construct dialogue actions from large-scale dialogues and represent each natural language (NL) response as a sequence of dialogue actions. Further, we train a Sequence-to-Sequence model which takes the dialogue history as input and outputs sequence of dialogue actions. The generated dialogue actions are transformed into verbal responses. Experimental results show that our light-weighted method achieves competitive performance, and has the advantage of controllability and efficiency. |[2304.00884v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00884v1)|null|

Using classification decoders over generative decoders allows AUTODIAL to significantly reduce memory footprint and achieve faster inference times compared to existing generative approach namely SimpleTOD. We demonstrate that AUTODIAL provides 3-6x speedups during inference while having 11x fewer parameters on three dialogue tasks compared to SimpleTOD. Our results show that extending current dialogue models to have parallel decoders can be a viable alternative for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. |[2303.06245v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06245v3)|null|
|**2023-02-20**|**Fantastic Rewards and How to Tame Them: A Case Study on Reward Learning for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL|When learning task-oriented dialogue (ToD) agents, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can naturally be utilized to train dialogue strategies to achieve user-specific goals. Prior works mainly focus on adopting advanced RL techniques to train the ToD agents, while the design of the reward function is not well studied. This paper aims at answering the question of how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent. With the proposed techniques, we achieve competitive results on the E2E response-generation task on the Multiwoz 2.0 dataset. Source code and checkpoints are publicly released at https://github.com/Shentao-YANG/Fantastic_Reward_ICLR2023. |[2302.10342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10342v1)|**[link](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz)**|
|**2023-02-18**|**Zero and Few-Shot Localization of Task-Oriented Dialogue Agents with a Distilled Representation**|cs.CL|Task-oriented Dialogue (ToD) agents are mostly limited to a few widely-spoken languages, mainly due to the high cost of acquiring training data for each language. Existing low-cost approaches that rely on cross-lingual embeddings or naive machine translation sacrifice a lot of accuracy for data efficiency, and largely fail in creating a usable dialogue agent. We propose automatic methods that use ToD training data in a source language to build a high-quality functioning dialogue agent in another target language that has no training data (i.e. zero-shot) or a small training set (i.e. few-shot). Unlike most prior work in cross-lingual ToD that only focuses on Dialogue State Tracking (DST), we build an end-to-end agent.   We show that our approach closes the accuracy gap between few-shot and existing full-shot methods for ToD agents. We achieve this by (1) improving the dialogue data representation, (2) improving entity-aware machine translation, and (3) automatic filtering of noisy translations.   We evaluate our approach on the recent bilingual dialogue dataset BiToD. In Chinese to English transfer, in the zero-shot setting, our method achieves 46.7% and 22.0% in Task Success Rate (TSR) and Dialogue Success Rate (DSR) respectively. In the few-shot setting where 10% of the data in the target language is used, we improve the state-of-the-art by 15.2% and 14.0%, coming within 5% of full-shot training. |[2302.09424v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09424v1)|**[link](https://github.com/stanford-oval/dialogues)**|
|**2023-01-29**|**Schema-Guided Semantic Accuracy: Faithfulness in Task-Oriented Dialogue Response Generation**|cs.CL|Ensuring that generated utterances are faithful to dialogue actions is crucial for Task-Oriented Dialogue Response Generation. Slot Error Rate (SER) only partially measures generation quality in that it solely assesses utterances generated from non-categorical slots whose values are expected to be reproduced exactly. Utterances generated from categorical slots, which are more variable, are not assessed by SER. We propose Schema-Guided Semantic Accuracy (SGSAcc) to evaluate utterances generated from both categorical and non-categorical slots by recognizing textual entailment. We show that SGSAcc can be applied to evaluate utterances generated from a wide range of dialogue actions in the Schema Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset with good agreement with human judgment. We also identify a previously overlooked weakness in generating faithful utterances from categorical slots in unseen domains. We show that prefix tuning applied to T5 generation can address this problem. We further build an ensemble of prefix-tuning and fine-tuning models that achieves the lowest SER reported and high SGSAcc on the SGD dataset. |[2301.12568v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12568v1)|**[link](https://github.com/erichen0615/schemaguidedsemanticaccuracy)**|
|**2023-05-24**|**Can Current Task-oriented Dialogue Models Automate Real-world Scenarios in the Wild?**|cs.CL|Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are mainly based on the slot-filling-based TOD (SF-TOD) framework, in which dialogues are broken down into smaller, controllable units (i.e., slots) to fulfill a specific task. A series of approaches based on this framework achieved remarkable success on various TOD benchmarks. However, we argue that the current TOD benchmarks are limited to surrogate real-world scenarios and that the current TOD models are still a long way to cover the scenarios. In this position paper, we first identify current status and limitations of SF-TOD systems. After that, we explore the WebTOD framework, the alternative direction for building a scalable TOD system when a web/mobile interface is available. In WebTOD, the dialogue system learns how to understand the web/mobile interface that the human agent interacts with, powered by a large-scale language model. |[2212.10504v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10504v2)|null|

These systems are typically constructed for a single domain or language and do not generalise well beyond this. To support work on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in TOD across multiple languages and domains simultaneously, we constructed MULTI3NLU++, a multilingual, multi-intent, multi-domain dataset. MULTI3NLU++ extends the English only NLU++ dataset to include manual translations into a range of high, medium, and low resource languages (Spanish, Marathi, Turkish and Amharic), in two domains (BANKING and HOTELS). Because of its multi-intent property, MULTI3NLU++ represents complex and natural user goals, and therefore allows us to measure the realistic performance of TOD systems in a varied set of the world's languages. We use MULTI3NLU++ to benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual models for the NLU tasks of intent detection and slot labelling for TOD systems in the multilingual setting. The results demonstrate the challenging nature of the dataset, particularly in the low-resource language setting, offering ample room for future experimentation in multi-domain multilingual TOD setups. |[2212.10455v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10455v2)|null|
|**2022-12-20**|**Dialog2API: Task-Oriented Dialogue with API Description and Example Programs**|cs.CL|Functionality and dialogue experience are two important factors of task-oriented dialogue systems. Conventional approaches with closed schema (e.g., conversational semantic parsing) often fail as both the functionality and dialogue experience are strongly constrained by the underlying schema. We introduce a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue - Dialog2API - to greatly expand the functionality and provide seamless dialogue experience. The conversational model interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs triggering a set of pre-defined APIs. The model also manages the dialogue policy and interact with the user through generating appropriate natural language responses. By allowing generating free-form programs, Dialog2API supports composite goals by combining different APIs, whereas unrestricted program revision provides natural and robust dialogue experience. To facilitate Dialog2API, the core model is provided with API documents, an execution environment and optionally some example dialogues annotated with programs. We propose an approach tailored for the Dialog2API, where the dialogue states are represented by a stack of programs, with most recently mentioned program on the top of the stack. Dialog2API can work with many application scenarios such as software automation and customer service. In this paper, we construct a dataset for AWS S3 APIs and present evaluation results of in-context learning baselines. |[2212.09946v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09946v1)|null|
|**2022-12-15**|**Injecting Domain Knowledge in Language Models for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Pre-trained language models (PLM) have advanced the state-of-the-art across NLP applications, but lack domain-specific knowledge that does not naturally occur in pre-training data. Previous studies augmented PLMs with symbolic knowledge for different downstream NLP tasks. However, knowledge bases (KBs) utilized in these studies are usually large-scale and static, in contrast to small, domain-specific, and modifiable knowledge bases that are prominent in real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. In this paper, we showcase the advantages of injecting domain-specific knowledge prior to fine-tuning on TOD tasks. To this end, we utilize light-weight adapters that can be easily integrated with PLMs and serve as a repository for facts learned from different KBs. To measure the efficacy of proposed knowledge injection methods, we introduce Knowledge Probing using Response Selection (KPRS) -- a probe designed specifically for TOD models. Experiments on KPRS and the response generation task show improvements of knowledge injection with adapters over strong baselines. |[2212.08120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08120v1)|**[link](https://github.com/amazon-research/domain-knowledge-injection)**|

However, prior work has demonstrated that semantic parsing is a difficult multilingual transfer task with low transfer efficiency compared to other tasks. In global markets such as India and Latin America, this is a critical issue as switching between languages is prevalent for bilingual users. In this work we dramatically improve the zero-shot performance of a multilingual and codeswitched semantic parsing system using two stages of multilingual alignment. First, we show that constrastive alignment pretraining improves both English performance and transfer efficiency. We then introduce a constrained optimization approach for hyperparameter-free adversarial alignment during finetuning. Our Doubly Aligned Multilingual Parser (DAMP) improves mBERT transfer performance by 3x, 6x, and 81x on the Spanglish, Hinglish and Multilingual Task Oriented Parsing benchmarks respectively and outperforms XLM-R and mT5-Large using 3.2x fewer parameters. |[2212.08054v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08054v2)|**[link](https://github.com/salt-nlp/damp)**|

However, these usually use word or sentence level similarities to detect the relevant knowledge context, which only partially capture the topical level relevance. In this paper, we examine how to better integrate topical information in knowledge grounded task-oriented dialogue and propose ``Topic-Aware Response Generation'' (TARG), an end-to-end response generation model. TARG incorporates multiple topic-aware attention mechanisms to derive the importance weighting scheme over dialogue utterances and external knowledge sources towards a better understanding of the dialogue history. Experimental results indicate that TARG achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge selection and response generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 3.2, 3.6, and 4.2 points in EM, F1 and BLEU-4 respectively on Doc2Dial, and performing comparably with previous work on DSTC9; both being knowledge-grounded task-oriented dialogue datasets. |[2212.05373v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05373v1)|**[link](https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research)**|

We postulate there are two salient factors for automatic induction of intents: (1) clustering algorithm for intent labeling and (2) user utterance embedding space. We compare existing off-the-shelf clustering models and embeddings based on DSTC11 evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the combined selection of utterance embedding and clustering method in the intent induction task should be carefully considered. We also present that pretrained MiniLM with Agglomerative clustering shows significant improvement in NMI, ARI, F1, accuracy and example coverage in intent induction tasks.

The complexity and cost involved in schema development and data collection is often a major barrier for such designers, limiting their ability to create natural, user-friendly experiences. We frame the classification of user intent as the generation of a canonical form, a lightweight semantic representation using natural language. We show that canonical forms offer a promising alternative to traditional methods for intent classification. By tuning soft prompts for a frozen large language model, we show that canonical forms generalize very well to new, unseen domains in a zero- or few-shot setting. The method is also sample-efficient, reducing the complexity and effort of developing new task-oriented dialogue domains. |[2211.05596v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05596v1)|null|
|**2022-12-17**|**Reranking Overgenerated Responses for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL|End-to-end (E2E) task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are prone to fall into the so-called "likelihood trap", resulting in generated responses which are dull, repetitive, and often inconsistent with dialogue history. Comparing ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the "gold response" (from evaluation data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in this work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses, that is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of overgenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to select high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated by the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring function to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus low-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all generated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the similarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim is to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the high-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history. We validate the robustness and versatility of our proposed method on the standard MultiWOZ dataset: our methods improve a state-of-the-art E2E ToD system by 2.0 BLEU, 1.6 ROUGE, and 1.3 METEOR scores, achieving new peak results. Additional experiments on the BiTOD dataset and human evaluation further ascertain the generalisability and effectiveness of the proposed framework. |[2211.03648v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03648v2)|**[link](https://github.com/cambridgeltl/response_reranking)**|

First, we provide a simple algorithm to semi-automatically create a high-coverage template set from historic conversations without any annotation. Second, we propose a neural architecture that encodes the dialogue context and applicable business constraints as profile features for ranking the next turn. Third, we describe a two-stage learning strategy with self-supervised training, followed by supervised fine-tuning on limited data collected through a human-in-the-loop platform. Finally, we describe offline experiments and present results of deploying our model with human-in-the-loop to converse with live customers online. |[2210.14379v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14379v1)|null|

While this approach can handle a wide range of queries, it does not extract the information needed to handle more complex queries that contain relationships between slots. We propose integration of relation extraction into this pipeline as an effective way to expand the capabilities of dialogue systems. We evaluate our approach by using an internal dataset with slot and relation annotations spanning three domains. Finally, we show how slot-filling annotation schemes can be simplified once the expressive power of relation annotations is available, reducing the number of slots while still capturing the user's intended meaning. |[2210.13344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13344v1)|null|
|**2022-10-24**|**Are Current Task-oriented Dialogue Systems Able to Satisfy Impolite Users?**|cs.CL|Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems have assisted users on many tasks, including ticket booking and service inquiries. While existing TOD systems have shown promising performance in serving customer needs, these systems mostly assume that users would interact with the dialogue agent politely. This assumption is unrealistic as impatient or frustrated customers may also interact with TOD systems impolitely. This paper aims to address this research gap by investigating impolite users' effects on TOD systems. Specifically, we constructed an impolite dialogue corpus and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the state-of-the-art TOD systems on our impolite dialogue corpus. Our experimental results show that existing TOD systems are unable to handle impolite user utterances. We also present a data augmentation method to improve TOD performance in impolite dialogues. Nevertheless, handling impolite dialogues remains a very challenging research task. We hope by releasing the impolite dialogue corpus and establishing the benchmark evaluations, more researchers are encouraged to investigate this new challenging research task. |[2210.12942v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12942v1)|null|
|**2022-11-24**|**Prompt Conditioned VAE: Enhancing Generative Replay for Lifelong Learning in Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|Lifelong learning (LL) is vital for advanced task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems. To address the catastrophic forgetting issue of LL, generative replay methods are widely employed to consolidate past knowledge with generated pseudo samples. However, most existing generative replay methods use only a single task-specific token to control their models. This scheme is usually not strong enough to constrain the generative model due to insufficient information involved. In this paper, we propose a novel method, prompt conditioned VAE for lifelong learning (PCLL), to enhance generative replay by incorporating tasks' statistics. PCLL captures task-specific distributions with a conditional variational autoencoder, conditioned on natural language prompts to guide the pseudo-sample generation. Moreover, it leverages a distillation process to further consolidate past knowledge by alleviating the noise in pseudo samples. Experiments on natural language understanding tasks of ToD systems demonstrate that PCLL significantly outperforms competitive baselines in building LL models. |[2210.07783v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07783v2)|**[link](https://github.com/alibabaresearch/damo-convai)**|

In this paper, we introduce a novel query-driven task-oriented dialogue system, namely Q-TOD. The essential information from the dialogue context is extracted into a query, which is further employed to retrieve relevant knowledge records for response generation. Firstly, as the query is in the form of natural language and not confined to the schema of the knowledge base, the issue of domain adaption is alleviated remarkably in Q-TOD. Secondly, as the query enables the decoupling of knowledge retrieval from the generation, Q-TOD gets rid of the issue of knowledge base scalability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-TOD, we collect query annotations for three publicly available task-oriented dialogue datasets. Comprehensive experiments verify that Q-TOD outperforms strong baselines and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. |[2210.07564v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07564v1)|null|

In practice, they may have to handle simultaneously several domains and tasks. The dialogue manager must therefore be able to take into account domain changes and plan over different domains/tasks in order to deal with multidomain dialogues. However, learning with reinforcement in such context becomes difficult because the state-action dimension is larger while the reward signal remains scarce. Our experimental results suggest that structured policies based on graph neural networks combined with different degrees of imitation learning can effectively handle multi-domain dialogues. The reported experiments underline the benefit of structured policies over standard policies. |[2210.05252v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05252v1)|null|

Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for language generation tasks, we propose ANTOR, a method for Adaptive Natural language generation for Task-Oriented dialogue via Reinforcement learning. In ANTOR, a natural language understanding (NLU) module, which corresponds to the user's understanding of system utterances, is incorporated into the objective function of RL. If the NLG's intentions are correctly conveyed to the NLU, which understands a system's utterances, the NLG is given a positive reward. We conducted experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, and we confirmed that ANTOR could generate adaptive utterances against speech recognition errors and the different vocabulary levels of users. |[2209.07873v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07873v1)|**[link](https://github.com/nu-dialogue/antor)**|

Unlike chit-chat dialogue models, task-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules: dialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state consists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user's constraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two pretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual text data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the information extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method and downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple recovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG, respectively. The second phase is to fine-tune the pretrained model on the TOD data. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an exciting boost and get competitive performance even without any TOD data on CamRest676 and MultiWOZ benchmarks. |[2209.04595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04595v1)|null|

In this respect, DSTC10-Track2-Task2 is proposed, which aims to build a task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system incorporating unstructured external knowledge on a spoken conversation, extending DSTC9-Track1. This paper introduces our system containing four advanced methods: data construction, weighted negative sampling, post-training, and style transfer. We first automatically construct a large training data because DSTC10-Track2 does not release the official training set. For the knowledge selection task, we propose weighted negative sampling to train the model more fine-grained manner. We also employ post-training and style transfer for the response generation task to generate an appropriate response with a similar style to the target response.

|**2022-08-22**|**Adapting Task-Oriented Dialogue Models for Email Conversations**|cs.CL|Intent detection is a key part of any Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system of a conversational assistant. Detecting the correct intent is essential yet difficult for email conversations where multiple directives and intents are present. In such settings, conversation context can become a key disambiguating factor for detecting the user's request from the assistant. One prominent way of incorporating context is modeling past conversation history like task-oriented dialogue models. However, the nature of email conversations (long form) restricts direct usage of the latest advances in task-oriented dialogue models. So in this paper, we provide an effective transfer learning framework (EMToD) that allows the latest development in dialogue models to be adapted for long-form conversations. We show that the proposed EMToD framework improves intent detection performance over pre-trained language models by 45% and over pre-trained dialogue models by 30% for task-oriented email conversations. Additionally, the modular nature of the proposed framework allows plug-and-play for any future developments in both pre-trained language and task-oriented dialogue models. |[2208.09439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09439v1)|null|

Previous work typically follows the intent-slot framework, which is easy for annotation yet limited in scalability for complex linguistic expressions. A line of works alleviates the representation issue by introducing hierarchical structures but challenging to express complex compositional semantics, such as negation and coreference. We propose Dialogue Meaning Representation (DMR), a pliable and easily extendable representation for task-oriented dialogue. Our representation contains a set of nodes and edges to represent rich compositional semantics. Moreover, we propose an inheritance hierarchy mechanism focusing on domain extensibility. Additionally, we annotated DMR-FastFood, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with more than 70k utterances, with DMR. We propose two evaluation tasks to evaluate different dialogue models and a novel coreference resolution model GNNCoref for the graph-based coreference resolution task. Experiments show that DMR can be parsed well with pre-trained Seq2Seq models, and GNNCoref outperforms the baseline models by a large margin. |[2204.10989v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10989v3)|**[link](https://github.com/amazon-research/dialogue-meaning-representation)**|

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for structure extraction in task-oriented dialogues. We first detect and cluster possible slot tokens with a pre-trained model to approximate dialogue ontology for a target domain. Then we track the status of each identified token group and derive a state transition structure. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms unsupervised baseline models by far in dialogue structure extraction. In addition, we show that data augmentation based on extracted structures enriches the surface formats of training data and can achieve a significant performance boost in dialogue response generation. |[2203.00073v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00073v3)|**[link](https://github.com/salesforce/dialog-flow-extraction)**|
|**2022-02-10**|**Logical Reasoning for Task Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI|In recent years, large pretrained models have been used in dialogue systems to improve successful task completion rates. However, lack of reasoning capabilities of dialogue platforms make it difficult to provide relevant and fluent responses, unless the designers of a conversational experience spend a considerable amount of time implementing these capabilities in external rule based modules. In this work, we propose a novel method to fine-tune pretrained transformer models such as Roberta and T5. to reason over a set of facts in a given dialogue context. Our method includes a synthetic data generation mechanism which helps the model learn logical relations, such as comparison between list of numerical values, inverse relations (and negation), inclusion and exclusion for categorical attributes, and application of a combination of attributes over both numerical and categorical values, and spoken form for numerical values, without need for additional training dataset. We show that the transformer based model can perform logical reasoning to answer questions when the dialogue context contains all the required information, otherwise it is able to extract appropriate constraints to pass to downstream components (e.g. a knowledge base) when partial information is available. We observe that transformer based models such as UnifiedQA-T5 can be fine-tuned to perform logical reasoning (such as numerical and categorical attributes' comparison) over attributes that been seen in training time (e.g., accuracy of 90\%+ for comparison of smaller than $k_{\max}$=5 values over heldout test dataset). |[2202.04161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04161v1)|null|
|**2021-12-24**|**Investigating Effect of Dialogue History in Multilingual Task Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI|While the English virtual assistants have achieved exciting performance with an enormous amount of training resources, the needs of non-English-speakers have not been satisfied well. Up to Dec 2021, Alexa, one of the most popular smart speakers around the world, is able to support 9 different languages [1], while there are thousands of languages in the world, 91 of which are spoken by more than 10 million people according to statistics published in 2019 [2]. However, training a virtual assistant in other languages than English is often more difficult, especially for those low-resource languages. The lack of high-quality training data restricts the performance of models, resulting in poor user satisfaction. Therefore, we devise an efficient and effective training solution for multilingual task-orientated dialogue systems, using the same dataset generation pipeline and end-to-end dialogue system architecture as BiToD[5], which adopted some key design choices for a minimalistic natural language design where formal dialogue states are used in place of natural language inputs. This reduces the room for error brought by weaker natural language models, and ensures the model can correctly extract the essential slot values needed to perform dialogue state tracking (DST). Our goal is to reduce the amount of natural language encoded at each turn, and the key parameter we investigate is the number of turns (H) to feed as history to model. We first explore the turning point where increasing H begins to yield limiting returns on the overall performance. Then we examine whether the examples a model with small H gets wrong can be categorized in a way for the model to do few-shot finetuning on. Lastly, will explore the limitations of this approach, and whether there is a certain type of examples that this approach will not be able to resolve. |[2112.12318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12318v1)|null|
|**2023-02-21**|**Contextual Semantic Parsing for Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Robust state tracking for task-oriented dialogue systems currently remains restricted to a few popular languages. This paper shows that given a large-scale dialogue data set in one language, we can automatically produce an effective semantic parser for other languages using machine translation. We propose automatic translation of dialogue datasets with alignment to ensure faithful translation of slot values and eliminate costly human supervision used in previous benchmarks. We also propose a new contextual semantic parsing model, which encodes the formal slots and values, and only the last agent and user utterances. We show that the succinct representation reduces the compounding effect of translation errors, without harming the accuracy in practice.   We evaluate our approach on several dialogue state tracking benchmarks. On RiSAWOZ, CrossWOZ, CrossWOZ-EN, and MultiWOZ-ZH datasets we improve the state of the art by 11%, 17%, 20%, and 0.3% in joint goal accuracy. We present a comprehensive error analysis for all three datasets showing erroneous annotations can lead to misguided judgments on the quality of the model.   Finally, we present RiSAWOZ English and German datasets, created using our translation methodology. On these datasets, accuracy is within 11% of the original showing that high-accuracy multilingual dialogue datasets are possible without relying on expensive human annotations. We release our datasets and software open source. |[2111.02574v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02574v2)|null|

Automatically summarizing such task-oriented dialogues can help a business collect and review needs to improve the service. Besides, previous datasets pay more attention to generate good summaries with higher ROUGE scores, but they hardly understand the structured information of dialogues and ignore the factuality of summaries. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale public Task-Oriented Dialogue Summarization dataset, TODSum, which aims to summarize the key points of the agent completing certain tasks with the user. Compared to existing work, TODSum suffers from severe scattered information issues and requires strict factual consistency, which makes it hard to directly apply recent dialogue summarization models. Therefore, we introduce additional dialogue state knowledge for TODSum to enhance the faithfulness of generated summaries. We hope a better understanding of conversational content helps summarization models generate concise and coherent summaries. Meanwhile, we establish a comprehensive benchmark for TODSum and propose a state-aware structured dialogue summarization model to integrate dialogue state information and dialogue history. Exhaustive experiments and qualitative analysis prove the effectiveness of dialogue structure guidance. Finally, we discuss the current issues of TODSum and potential development directions for future work. |[2110.12680v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12680v1)|null|
|**2021-10-18**|**UniDS: A Unified Dialogue System for Chit-Chat and Task-oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|With the advances in deep learning, tremendous progress has been made with chit-chat dialogue systems and task-oriented dialogue systems. However, these two systems are often tackled separately in current methods. To achieve more natural interaction with humans, a dialogue agent needs to be capable of both chatting and accomplishing tasks. To this end, we propose a unified dialogue system (UniDS) with the two aforementioned skills. In particular, we design a unified dialogue data schema, compatible for both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues, and we train UniDS with mixed dialogue data from a pretrained chit-chat dialogue model. Without adding extra parameters to SOTA baselines, UniDS can alternatively handle chit-chat and task-oriented dialogues in a unified framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UniDS works comparably well as the pure chit-chat system, and it outperforms state-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems. More importantly, UniDS achieves better robustness as it is able to smoothly switch between two types of dialogues. These results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of building an one-for-all dialogue system. |[2110.08032v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08032v1)|null|
|**2022-04-26**|**Task-Oriented Dialogue System as Natural Language Generation**|cs.CL, cs.AI|In this paper, we propose to formulate the task-oriented dialogue system as the purely natural language generation task, so as to fully leverage the large-scale pre-trained models like GPT-2 and simplify complicated delexicalization prepossessing. However, directly applying this method heavily suffers from the dialogue entity inconsistency caused by the removal of delexicalized tokens, as well as the catastrophic forgetting problem of the pre-trained model during fine-tuning, leading to unsatisfactory performance. To alleviate these problems, we design a novel GPT-Adapter-CopyNet network, which incorporates the lightweight adapter and CopyNet modules into GPT-2 to achieve better performance on transfer learning and dialogue entity generation. Experimental results conducted on the DSTC8 Track 1 benchmark and MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline models with a remarkable performance on automatic and human evaluations. |[2108.13679v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13679v3)|**[link](https://github.com/victorwz/tod_as_nlg)**|
|**2021-06-10**|**High-Quality Diversification for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.HC|Many task-oriented dialogue systems use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn policies that respond to the user appropriately and complete the tasks successfully. Training DRL agents with diverse dialogue trajectories prepare them well for rare user requests and unseen situations. One effective diversification method is to let the agent interact with a diverse set of learned user models. However, trajectories created by these artificial user models may contain generation errors, which can quickly propagate into the agent's policy. It is thus important to control the quality of the diversification and resist the noise. In this paper, we propose a novel dialogue diversification method for task-oriented dialogue systems trained in simulators. Our method, Intermittent Short Extension Ensemble (I-SEE), constrains the intensity to interact with an ensemble of diverse user models and effectively controls the quality of the diversification. Evaluations on the Multiwoz dataset show that I-SEE successfully boosts the performance of several state-of-the-art DRL dialogue agents. |[2106.00891v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00891v2)|**[link](https://github.com/smt-HS/I-SEE)**|

We show that in the popular end-to-end approach, this choice prevents the model from learning to generate linguistically richer dialogues, since the acquisition of language proficiency takes longer than learning the guessing task. By comparing models playing different games (GuessWhat, GuessWhich, and Mutual Friends), we show that this discrepancy is model- and task-agnostic. We investigate whether and when better language quality could lead to higher task success. We show that in GuessWhat, models could increase their accuracy if they learn to ground, encode, and decode also words that do not occur frequently in the training set. |[2103.11151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11151v1)|**[link](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/cocoa)**|
|**2021-03-22**|**Pretraining the Noisy Channel Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|Direct decoding for task-oriented dialogue is known to suffer from the explaining-away effect, manifested in models that prefer short and generic responses. Here we argue for the use of Bayes' theorem to factorize the dialogue task into two models, the distribution of the context given the response, and the prior for the response itself. This approach, an instantiation of the noisy channel model, both mitigates the explaining-away effect and allows the principled incorporation of large pretrained models for the response prior. We present extensive experiments showing that a noisy channel model decodes better responses compared to direct decoding and that a two stage pretraining strategy, employing both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue data, improves over randomly initialized models. |[2103.10518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10518v1)|null|

In this paper, we propose a continual learning benchmark for task-oriented dialogue systems with 37 domains to be learned continuously in four settings, such as intent recognition, state tracking, natural language generation, and end-to-end. Moreover, we implement and compare multiple existing continual learning baselines, and we propose a simple yet effective architectural method based on residual adapters. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architectural method and a simple replay-based strategy perform comparably well but they both achieve inferior performance to the multi-task learning baseline, in where all the data are shown at once, showing that continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging task. Furthermore, we reveal several trade-offs between different continual learning methods in term of parameter usage and memory size, which are important in the design of a task-oriented dialogue system. The proposed benchmark is released together with several baselines to promote more research in this direction. |[2012.15504v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15504v1)|**[link](https://github.com/andreamad8/ToDCL)**|
|**2021-05-04**|**Adding Chit-Chat to Enhance Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|Existing dialogue corpora and models are typically designed under two disjoint motives: while task-oriented systems focus on achieving functional goals (e.g., booking hotels), open-domain chatbots aim at making socially engaging conversations. In this work, we propose to integrate both types of systems by Adding Chit-Chat to ENhance Task-ORiented dialogues (ACCENTOR), with the goal of making virtual assistant conversations more engaging and interactive. Specifically, we propose a Human <-> AI collaborative data collection approach for generating diverse chit-chat responses to augment task-oriented dialogues with minimal annotation effort. We then present our new chit-chat-based annotations to 23.8K dialogues from two popular task-oriented datasets (Schema-Guided Dialogue and MultiWOZ 2.1) and demonstrate their advantage over the originals via human evaluation. Lastly, we propose three new models for adding chit-chat to task-oriented dialogues, explicitly trained to predict user goals and to generate contextually relevant chit-chat responses. Automatic and human evaluations show that, compared with the state-of-the-art task-oriented baseline, our models can code-switch between task and chit-chat to be more engaging, interesting, knowledgeable, and humanlike, while maintaining competitive task performance. |[2010.12757v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12757v2)|null|
|**2021-02-12**|**Task-Oriented Dialogue as Dataflow Synthesis**|cs.CL|We describe an approach to task-oriented dialogue in which dialogue state is represented as a dataflow graph. A dialogue agent maps each user utterance to a program that extends this graph. Programs include metacomputation operators for reference and revision that reuse dataflow fragments from previous turns. Our graph-based state enables the expression and manipulation of complex user intents, and explicit metacomputation makes these intents easier for learned models to predict. We introduce a new dataset, SMCalFlow, featuring complex dialogues about events, weather, places, and people. Experiments show that dataflow graphs and metacomputation substantially improve representability and predictability in these natural dialogues. Additional experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset show that our dataflow representation enables an otherwise off-the-shelf sequence-to-sequence model to match the best existing task-specific state tracking model. The SMCalFlow dataset and code for replicating experiments are available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dataflow-based-dialogue-semantic-machines. |[2009.11423v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11423v3)|null|
|**2022-04-14**|**A Simple Language Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue**|cs.CL|Task-oriented dialogue is often decomposed into three tasks: understanding user input, deciding actions, and generating a response. While such decomposition might suggest a dedicated model for each sub-task, we find a simple, unified approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on the MultiWOZ dataset. SimpleTOD is a simple approach to task-oriented dialogue that uses a single, causal language model trained on all sub-tasks recast as a single sequence prediction problem. This allows SimpleTOD to fully leverage transfer learning from pre-trained, open domain, causal language models such as GPT-2. SimpleTOD improves over the prior state-of-the-art in joint goal accuracy for dialogue state tracking, and our analysis reveals robustness to noisy annotations in this setting. SimpleTOD also improves the main metrics used to evaluate action decisions and response generation in an end-to-end setting: inform rate by 8.1 points, success rate by 9.7 points, and combined score by 7.2 points. |[2005.00796v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00796v4)|**[link](https://github.com/salesforce/simpletod)**|

In this work, we investigate two methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG) using a single domain-independent model across a large number of APIs. First, we propose a schema-guided approach which conditions the generation on a schema describing the API in natural language. Our second method investigates the use of a small number of templates, growing linearly in number of slots, to convey the semantics of the API. To generate utterances for an arbitrary slot combination, a few simple templates are first concatenated to give a semantically correct, but possibly incoherent and ungrammatical utterance. A pre-trained language model is subsequently employed to rewrite it into coherent, natural sounding text. Through automatic metrics and human evaluation, we show that our method improves over strong baselines, is robust to out-of-domain inputs and shows improved sample efficiency. |[2004.15006v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15006v2)|null|

An alternative solution is to rely on automatic text generation which, although less accurate than human supervision, has the advantage of being cheap and fast. In this paper we propose a novel controlled data generation method that could be used as a training augmentation framework for closed-domain dialogue. Our contribution is twofold. First we show how to optimally train and control the generation of intent-specific sentences using a conditional variational autoencoder. Then we introduce a novel protocol called query transfer that allows to leverage a broad, unlabelled dataset to extract relevant information. Comparison with two different baselines shows that our method, in the appropriate regime, consistently improves the diversity of the generated queries without compromising their quality. |[1911.03698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03698v1)|**[link](https://github.com/snipsco/automatic-data-generation)**|

We study the effect of alternating between different domains in sequences of dialogue turns using two related state-of-the-art dialogue systems. We first show that a specialized state tracking component in multiple domains plays an important role and gives better results than an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system. We then propose a hybrid system which is able to improve the belief tracking accuracy of about 28% of average absolute point on a standard multi-domain dialogue dataset. These experimental results give some useful insights for improving our commercial chatbot platform FPT.AI, which is currently deployed for many practical chatbot applications. |[1909.02265v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02265v1)|null|
|**2019-09-02**|**Modeling Multi-Action Policy for Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL|Dialogue management (DM) plays a key role in the quality of the interaction with the user in a task-oriented dialogue system. In most existing approaches, the agent predicts only one DM policy action per turn. This significantly limits the expressive power of the conversational agent and introduces unwanted turns of interactions that may challenge users' patience. Longer conversations also lead to more errors and the system needs to be more robust to handle them. In this paper, we compare the performance of several models on the task of predicting multiple acts for each turn. A novel policy model is proposed based on a recurrent cell called gated Continue-Act-Slots (gCAS) that overcomes the limitations of the existing models. Experimental results show that gCAS outperforms other approaches. The code is available at https://leishu02.github.io/ |[1908.11546v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11546v1)|null|
|**2019-08-08**|**Flexibly-Structured Model for Task-Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG|This paper proposes a novel end-to-end architecture for task-oriented dialogue systems. It is based on a simple and practical yet very effective sequence-to-sequence approach, where language understanding and state tracking tasks are modeled jointly with a structured copy-augmented sequential decoder and a multi-label decoder for each slot. The policy engine and language generation tasks are modeled jointly following that. The copy-augmented sequential decoder deals with new or unknown values in the conversation, while the multi-label decoder combined with the sequential decoder ensures the explicit assignment of values to slots. On the generation part, slot binary classifiers are used to improve performance. This architecture is scalable to real-world scenarios and is shown through an empirical evaluation to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the Cambridge Restaurant dataset and the Stanford in-car assistant dataset\footnote{The code is available at \url{https://github.com/uber-research/FSDM}} |[1908.02402v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02402v1)|**[link](https://github.com/uber-research/FSDM)**|

We are interested in building task-oriented dialogue systems from human-human conversations, which may be available in ample amounts in existing customer care center logs or can be collected from crowd workers. Annotating these datasets can be prohibitively expensive. Recently multiple annotated task-oriented human-machine dialogue datasets have been released, however their annotation schema varies across different collections, even for well-defined categories such as dialogue acts (DAs). We propose a Universal DA schema for task-oriented dialogues and align existing annotated datasets with our schema. Our aim is to train a Universal DA tagger (U-DAT) for task-oriented dialogues and use it for tagging human-human conversations. We investigate multiple datasets, propose manual and automated approaches for aligning the different schema, and present results on a target corpus of human-human dialogues. In unsupervised learning experiments we achieve an F1 score of 54.1% on system turns in human-human dialogues. In a semi-supervised setup, the F1 score increases to 57.7% which would otherwise require at least 1.7K manually annotated turns. For new domains, we show further improvements when unlabeled or labeled target domain data is available. |[1907.03020v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03020v1)|null|

BCS consists of (1) a Poisson-based global scheduler to allocate budget over different stages of training; (2) a controller to decide at each training step whether the agent is trained using real or simulated experiences; (3) a user goal sampling module to generate the experiences that are most effective for policy learning. Experiments on a movie-ticket booking task with simulated and real users show that our approach leads to significant improvements in success rate over the state-of-the-art baselines given the fixed budget. |[1906.00499v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00499v1)|null|

We show the effectiveness of our strategy by achieving good performance in multi-domain dialogue state tracking, retrieval-based dialogue systems, and generation-based dialogue systems. We first propose a transferable dialogue state generator (TRADE) that leverages its copy mechanism to get rid of dialogue ontology and share knowledge between domains. We also evaluate unseen domain dialogue state tracking and show that TRADE enables zero-shot dialogue state tracking and can adapt to new few-shot domains without forgetting the previous domains. Second, we utilize MANNs to improve retrieval-based dialogue learning. They are able to capture dialogue sequential dependencies and memorize long-term information. We also propose a recorded delexicalization copy strategy to replace real entity values with ordered entity types. Our models are shown to surpass other retrieval baselines, especially when the conversation has a large number of turns. Lastly, we tackle generation-based dialogue learning with two proposed models, the memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) and global-to-local memory pointer network (GLMP). Mem2Seq is the first model to combine multi-hop memory attention with the idea of the copy mechanism. GLMP further introduces the concept of response sketching and double pointers copying. We show that GLMP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on human evaluation. |[1905.07687v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07687v1)|null|
|**2018-11-13**|**User Modeling for Task Oriented Dialogues**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|We introduce end-to-end neural network based models for simulating users of task-oriented dialogue systems. User simulation in dialogue systems is crucial from two different perspectives: (i) automatic evaluation of different dialogue models, and (ii) training task-oriented dialogue systems. We design a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model that first encodes the initial user goal and system turns into fixed length representations using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It then encodes the dialogue history using another RNN layer. At each turn, user responses are decoded from the hidden representations of the dialogue level RNN. This hierarchical user simulator (HUS) approach allows the model to capture undiscovered parts of the user goal without the need of an explicit dialogue state tracking. We further develop several variants by utilizing a latent variable model to inject random variations into user responses to promote diversity in simulated user responses and a novel goal regularization mechanism to penalize divergence of user responses from the initial user goal. We evaluate the proposed models on movie ticket booking domain by systematically interacting each user simulator with various dialogue system policies trained with different objectives and users. |[1811.04369v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04369v1)|null|

Conversely, sequence-to-sequence models learn to map dialogue history to the response in current turn without explicit knowledge base querying. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advantages of classic pipeline and sequence-to-sequence models. Our framework models a dialogue state as a fixed-size distributed representation and use this representation to query a knowledge base via an attention mechanism. Experiment on Stanford Multi-turn Multi-domain Task-oriented Dialogue Dataset shows that our framework significantly outperforms other sequence-to-sequence based baseline models on both automatic and human evaluation. |[1806.04441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04441v1)|null|
|**2018-05-14**|**Memory-augmented Dialogue Management for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR|Dialogue management (DM) decides the next action of a dialogue system according to the current dialogue state, and thus plays a central role in task-oriented dialogue systems. Since dialogue management requires to have access to not only local utterances, but also the global semantics of the entire dialogue session, modeling the long-range history information is a critical issue. To this end, we propose a novel Memory-Augmented Dialogue management model (MAD) which employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures, i.e., a slot-value memory and an external memory. The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (for instance, cuisine, price, and location), and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks through storing more context information. To update the dialogue state efficiently, we also propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing baselines. |[1805.00150v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00150v1)|null|

To confirm this thesis, computer simulations are performed based on the coordination task presented by Garrod & Anderson (1987). The role of success in task-oriented dialogue is analytically evaluated with the help of performance measurements and a thorough lexical analysis of the emergent communication system. Simulation results confirm a strong effect of success mattering on both reliability and dispersion of linguistic conventions. |[1203.0512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0512v1)|null|
